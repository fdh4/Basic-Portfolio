                <p>I was born in 1955 with a fatal heart defect.  Thanks to the persistence of my mother 
                    (an OR nurse) and the genius of Drs. Richard Bing and Dr. C. Walton Lillehei, 
                    my defect was repaired when I was 5 months old.  I was among the first ten to survive 
                    open heart surgery on the heart-lung bypass pump invented by Drs. Lillehei and Dewall.
                    That groundbreaking device cost about $15 at the time!.  Talk about cost effective!
                    I have a lifelong commitment to pay it forward by helping others with seemingly 
                    incurable disease.
                </p>
                <p>I believe I am the longest survior of open heart surgery.  
                    Although Dr. Lillehei warned about possible brain damange, currently 
                    I am an experienced teaching and practicing Medical Oncologist at 
                    a Major Southern California Teaching Hospital. 
                </p>        
                <p>My hobbies include music, astronomy, reading, sailing, hiking, travel, theater 
                    and full stack web development!
                </p>        
                <p>My scientific background is biophysical chemistry and T lymphocyte membrane biology:
                    - PhD Stanford University with Prof. Harden McConnell 1981
               </p>        
                <p>My medical background is medical oncology:
                    - MD-Harvard Medical School 1985; Internship/Residency-Brigham and Women's Hospital 1985-1987.
                    - Fellowship at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute 1991; Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins 1993.     
                </p>        
                <p>My intrests in computers date back to college days and the PDP-8 (anyone remember DEC, FORTRAN and BASIC?)
                    </p>        
                <p>My dream is to leverage information techology into a tool that helps physicians care for 
                    their patients and helps patients get the care they need.
                    Currently the electronic medical record is a barrier between physicians and patients, 
                    demoralizing to physicians and enraging to patients.  Physician order entry is fraught with error prone possibilities.
                    Physician notes are often full of inaccurate or obsolete data.  We have a long way to go.  
                    I hope to be a part of the solution.
