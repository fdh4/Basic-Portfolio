        <p>I was born in 1955 with a fatal heart defect.  Thanks to the persistence of my mother 
            (an OR nurse) and the genius of Drs. Richard Bing and Dr. C. Walton Lillehei, 
            my defect was repaired when I was 5 months old.  I was among the first ten to survive 
            open heart surgery on the heart-lung bypass pump invented by Drs. Lillehei and Dewall.
            That groundbreaking device cost about $15 at the time!.  Talk about cost effective!
            That lifesaving experience inspired me to pay it forward by
             helping others with seemingly incurable disease.
        </p>
        <p>I believe I am the longest survior of open heart surgery (63 years and 10 months as of this writing).  
            Although Dr. Lillehei warned about possible brain damange, currently 
            I am an experienced teaching and practicing physician and former 
            Chief of Medical Oncology at a major Southern California teaching hospital. 
        </p>        
        <p>My scientific background is biophysical chemistry and T lymphocyte membrane biology:
                - PhD Stanford University with Prof. Harden McConnell 1981
        </p>        
        <p>My medical background is medical oncology:
        - MD-Harvard Medical School 1985; Internship/Residency-Brigham and Women's Hospital 1985-1987.
        - Fellowship at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute 1991; Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins 1993.     
        </p>        
        <p>My hobbies include music, astronomy, reading, sailing, hiking, travel, theater 
        and full stack web development!  My intrests in computers dates back to college days and the PDP-8 (anyone remember the days of DEC, FORTRAN and BASIC?)
        My dream is to leverage information techology into a tool that helps physicians care for 
        their patients and helps patients get the care they need.
        Currently the electronic medical record is a barrier between physicians and patients, 
        demoralizing to physicians and enraging to patients.  Physician order entry is fraught with error prone possibilities.
        Physician notes are often full of inaccurate or obsolete data.  We have a long way to go.  
        I hope to be a part of the solution.  This course is my first step towards that goal.
